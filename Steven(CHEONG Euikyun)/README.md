Credit Risk Analysis_euikyun.ipynb : This notebook contains the replication of original notebook and some improvements(ROC curve, additional plot for comparing scores)

Credit Risk Analysis_delete_column_with_high_corr.ipynb : This notebook is related to slide 'Deleting high correlated variables'. This notebook is used to run model with deleting the columns with high corr. 
Credit Risk Analysis_dropNA.ipynb : This notebook is related to slide 'Drop null value'. This notebook is used to run model with deleting the row with NA. 
Credit Risk Analysis_Catboost_LGBM.ipynb : This notebook is related to slide 'Catboost Classifier'. This notebook is used to run model with Catboost and LGBM classifier. 
Credit Risk Analysis_OutlierX.ipynb : This notebook is related to slide 'No outlier handling'. This notebook is used to run model without outlier handling. 


Credit_risk_analysis_external_data.ipynb : This notebook used external data and performed the best approachment to external dataset.
