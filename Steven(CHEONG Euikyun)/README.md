# Steven's Folder Overview

Steven is tasked with the modeling and optimization of Credit Risk Modeling. The folder contains various Jupyter notebooks detailing different approaches and methodologies applied in the domain of credit risk analysis.

## Main Analysis Notebooks

- **Credit Risk Analysis_euikyun.ipynb**: This notebook replicates the original analysis and incorporates improvements such as an ROC curve and an additional plot for comparing scores.
- **Credit Risk Analysis_delete_column_with_high_corr.ipynb**: Related to the "Deleting high correlated variables" slide, this notebook explores the impact of removing highly correlated variables on the model's performance.
- **Credit Risk Analysis_dropNA.ipynb**: Associated with the "Drop null value" slide, this notebook investigates the effects of removing rows with NA values on the modeling process.
- **Credit Risk Analysis_Catboost_LGBM.ipynb**: Corresponding to the "Catboost Classifier" slide, this notebook applies Catboost and LGBM classifiers to the credit risk modeling process.
- **Credit Risk Analysis_OutlierX.ipynb**: Linked to the "No outlier handling" slide, this notebook assesses the model performance without applying outlier handling techniques.
- **Credit_risk_analysis_external_data.ipynb**: Utilizes external data and demonstrates the best approach to integrating an external dataset into the credit risk analysis.

## Practice Notebooks (Not Used in Presentation)

- **Credit Risk Analysis_OutlierX_Automl.ipynb**: Introduces a new approach using the PyCaret library for conducting automated machine learning (AutoML), focusing on models without outlier handling.
- **Create Credit Risk Analysis_OutlierX_Automl.ipynb**: Similar to the above, this notebook applies a new methodology using the PyCaret library for AutoML, specifically targeting models without outlier handling.
- **Credit Risk Analysis_Outlier_Automl.ipynb**: Explores a new approach using the PyCaret library for AutoML, with a focus on outlier handling in the context of credit risk analysis.
